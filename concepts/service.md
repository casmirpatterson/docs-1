# KORD Service

This document outlines the concept of a KORD service, a participant in the
KORD network who is economically incentivised to provide a service to the
network and can be held accountable for its actions.

## Status of this Document

The KORD protocol is at an early stage of development, expect this document to
change frequently during this early phase.

## Outline

The KORD network aims to provide the infrastructure to build distributed,
decentralised databases where you don't necessarily need to trust all the
participants in the network to be well behaved, but you do trust that all
participants are economically motivated (i.e. they want to profit in some
way, either financially, morally or otherwise).

With this in mind, we define a KORD service as being a network participant who
provides a service to the network in return for KORD tokens, but also stakes an
amount of KORD tokens which can be claimed as collateral if the service is
proved to have misbehaved.

## Implementation

TODO: describe how the economic incentives can be implemented using Ethereum
      smart contracts.
